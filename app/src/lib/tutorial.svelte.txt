Welcome to vimgod, explorer.

You should know how to move but if you dont, 
you can use h, j, k, and l to move
left, down, up, and right, respectively.

Try it out - your  location is that white box.
Move it around and try to reach the purple box.

 time you reach the purple box, it will move.
In the real game, this is considered a "round".
A single match consists of multiple rounds.
